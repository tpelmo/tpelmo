# Kuzu zangpo la! 👋

### I'm Tenzin, an Economics graduate with a passion for finding patterns and working towards data-driven policy solutions.

My experience spans from managing foreign exchange and reserves management at Bhutan's Central Bank 🏦 to researching Washington State's homelessness and housing insecurity 🏘️ and analyzing City of Saint Paul's economic development initiatives 🤝. 

Currently seeking for new opportunities in economic research and policy analysis.
